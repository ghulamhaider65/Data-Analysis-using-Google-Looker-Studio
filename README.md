# Data Analysis using Google Looker Studio

## Project Overview
This project analyzes order data sourced from Kaggle and presents insights through a data analysis report created in Google Looker Studio. The dataset includes various aspects of orders, such as regions, categories, segments, cities, and trends over time.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle
- **Contents:** Orders, customers, regions, categories, and shipment details.

## Analysis and Visualization
The analysis focuses on:
- Number of orders by region, category, and segment
- Trends in orders over years and months
- Distribution of orders across cities
- Summary statistics like total orders, customers, and states covered

The final report has been visualized using **Google Looker Studio**, providing interactive insights into the dataset.

## Files Included
- `Orders_Dashboard.pdf`: The generated report visualizing order trends and distributions.
- `README.md`: Documentation of the project.
